Fractional Snow/Non-Snow Cover Mapping through Incorporation of Thermal Band in Snow Index Design

- In this work, the attempts are driven towards the attainment of the snow cover delineations through binary mapping techniques. 
- An improvement in degree of correlation is obtained over the conventional methodologies which serves for the verification of scheme employed and empirical relationship defined, collectively.
